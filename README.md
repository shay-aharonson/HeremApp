# HeremApp

Two week sample project. This Android app uses the third party Here API to retrieve data and display an interactive map of nearby points of interest based on user selected search radius and categories.
The app demonstrates usage of Kotlin, MVVM, Rx, Dagger, Realm, Glide, Google Map & API, Retrofit & OkHttp, BottomSheets and more.
The goal of this implementation was to be an MVP demonstration of the said items.
